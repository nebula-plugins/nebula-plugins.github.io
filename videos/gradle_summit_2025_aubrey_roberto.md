## From Lag to Lightning: Transforming Dependency Update Timelines (Aubrey Chipman and Roberto Perez Alcolea)

Discover how we transformed our dependency update process that led to the latest dependency versions undergoing zero-touch deployment in hours (rather than days or weeks) across thousands of repositories. This talk highlights our innovative use of dependency management resolution rules, automated SCM changes, and tracking them with post-deployment artifact observability tools, showcasing the efficiency and speed achieved. We also touch on future advancements, including language-agnostic tooling and proactive security measures, offering insights into maintaining robust and secure software delivery.
